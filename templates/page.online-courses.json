Our courses are taught by some of the most innovative and dynamic teachers in the farming industry. Why learn from farmers if you are a gardener? Because gardening on a grander scale is what they do every day as their chosen work. Like any profession, mastering the work to find the most efficient, easiest, and cost-effective way is what leads to success. Flower farmers are no different. Our instructors are sharing their years of first-hand experiences in both gardening and farming. You’ll love learning from online courses. It’s much like an in-person class but even better because you can watch at any time and for as many times as you want because you have forever access. It’s like purchasing a book, but instead of reaching for the book, reach for a device with internet access and log in to your course library to access your purchased courses.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["heading_bCEApJ","text_iewfrG"],"settings":{"desktop_content_position":"center","text_class":"","colorbg":"#ffffff","content_alignment":"center","color_scheme":"","full_width":true,"padding_top":52,"padding_bottom":0}},"collection_products_pWVbMd":{"type":"collection-products","settings":{"cat":"online-farming","label":"Farming & Business School Courses"}},"collection_products_AgHtdp":{"type":"collection-products","settings":{"cat":"on-demand-workshops","label":"Workshops"}},"multicolumn_883iVA":{"type":"multicolumn","blocks":{"column_pyzcRM":{"type":"column","settings":{"choose_type":"image","choose_video_type":"embed","column_video":"","subtitle":"","title":"Workshops","heading_size":"h2","text":"<p><strong>Workshops<\/strong> vary from sixty minutes to over five hours of instruction, see individual courses for details.
